# Spotify Clone

A simple Spotify clone built using **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. This project aims to replicate some of the core features of Spotify, such as a music player, playlists, and album details, while learning and experimenting with React and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Music Player**: A basic music player interface with play/pause functionality.
- **Playlists**: Displays a list of music playlists (static).
- **Album Details**: Shows album artwork and title for selected songs.
- **Navigation Bar**: A navigation bar for easy access to different sections.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface and managing the appâ€™s state.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **No backend**: Static data used for playlists and songs (not connected to an actual music API).

## Purpose

This project was built to:
- Learn how to manage state in React.
- Practice component design and styling using Tailwind CSS.
- Simulate some of Spotify's user interface (without full functionality like streaming music).
